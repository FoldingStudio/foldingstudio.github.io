              Vault
            </span>
              <img src="images/vault.png" alt="Immagine 1">
              <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; line-height: 1rem;">          The vault complex is the largest known eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein complex identified so far. These cellular particles were first described in 1986 as contaminants during a rat liver preparation. Further observations under the electron microscope revealed their cathedral vault-like morphology: a massive barrel-shaped structure measuring 40 x 40 x 70 nm with a molecular weight of approximately 13 MDa. It is composed of 78 copies of the major vault protein (MVP) along with additional proteins such as TEP1 and vPARP.
                The number of vaults is highly conserved and ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 per cell, depending on the species. Although their exact function is still being investigated, vaults are currently considered mediators of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. MVP, TEP1, vPARP, and vault-associated RNA have been implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, including multidrug resistance, apoptosis, cancer progression, epilepsy, and autophagy. </p>

              Green flourescent protein

              <img src="images/GFP.png" alt="Immagine 1">
              <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; line-height: 1rem;">This protein is called green fluorescent protein (GFP) and it was first isolated from Aequorea victoria, a beautiful jellyfish native to the coasts of North America. Since its discovery, this protein has been widely used in laboratories around the world to study gene expression, engineer new proteins, and analyze various biological parameters. All these applications are possible due to the GFP’s unique characteristic: it emits green light when excited by ultraviolet (UV) light.
                But how does this happen? GFP consists of two distinct structural regions. The first region is composed of 11 beta-strands that form a beta-barrel structure. The second region is an alpha-helix buried within the cavity of the beta-barrel, which includes the chromophore group responsible for absorbing and emitting light. The emission of green light is based on conformational changes and electron interactions between the amino acids located inside the cavity, in both the alpha-helix and beta-barrel regions. The mutation of these amino acids alters the absorption and emission spectra, leading to the generation of other fluorescent proteins, such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP).</p>

                Beta-amyloid

                <img src="images/amyloid.png" alt="Immagine 2">
                <p style="font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1rem;">This is a beta-amyloid, considered a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and one of its causes. But what distinguishes these plaques from the beta-amyloid protein itself? The distinction is critical to understanding the pathology of AD. Beta-amyloid peptides are normally present in non-pathological conditions and are derived from the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, when the cleavage process is dysregulated - due to mutations in APP or in the enzymes responsible for the cleavage - the beta-amyloid peptides aggregate and form insoluble plaques. These deposits accumulate in cerebral tissue, contributing to the neurodegenerative symptoms characteristic of AD: cognitive impairment and memory loss.</p>

                <p  style="font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1rem;">If proteins were professional fighters, titin would definitely be the heavyweight champion. While the mean length of a human protein is approximately 350 amino acids and the mean molecular weight is about 40 kDa, titin reaches an astonishing ~34,000 amino acids in length and over 3,000 kDa in weight, defeating every opponent.
                  Titin is a protein localized in muscle cells, where its role is to connect the thick and thin filaments, providing passive tension, elasticity, and serving as a signaling platform.</p>

                <p  style="font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1rem;">The Death would probably looks like this. What you are looking at is the heart of Ebola virus. It is composed of the nucleoprotein and the genes, which encodes 7 proteins used by the virus during its cycle.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; line-height: 1rem;">Infectious agents use different strategies to invade and survive in their hosts. For example, bacteria of the Salmonella genus, as part of their pathogenic mechanism, inject some of their proteins through a molecular needle called the injectosome. The injectosome is a macromolecule anchored in the bacterial membrane through its base (the region with the larger diameter in the picture), and can selectively inject specific “effector” proteins into the host’s cells through the tip of the injectosome (the region with the smaller diameter in the picture).
                The selection of effector proteins is a highly regulated process involving a gated molecular complex located at the tip of the needle, composed of SpaQ, SpaP, SpaR, and SpaS.</p>
