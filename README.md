# foldingstudio.github.io

Hi! My name is Lorenzo, and since I was a child, I've always been interested in science and graphic design. After obtaining my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Life Sciences — where I explored research areas such as electron microscopy and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) — I decided to combine my passions and launch the Folding Studio. The goal of this project is to create and share graphics of research-relevant molecules with a non-profit intent: it's completely free (a credit in your project is all I ask)!

Folding Studio is a project launched to provide free molecular graphics for magazines, student theses, scientific publications, and educational content. But that's not all: it's also an informative initiative designed to explore and share both the scientific and artistic aspects of proteins on social media. The project is continually evolving, so stay tuned! If you have any suggestions or would like custom graphics for your work, feel free to contact me!
